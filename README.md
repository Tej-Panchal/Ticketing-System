Project Highlights:

Prediction Model: Created a robust predictive model utilizing historical data and ticket attributes to forecast ticket resolution times. This involved preprocessing data, feature selection, and training models using techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
Automation: Implemented automation for assigning tickets to the most suitable support personnel, optimizing the workflow, and reducing manual intervention.
Performance Metrics: Developed a comprehensive tracking system to monitor ticket resolution performance. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average resolution time, ticket backlog, and resolution rate are tracked and reported, providing actionable insights to improve support processes.

Key Features:

Machine Learning: utilizes regression models and classification algorithms to predict resolution times. Implemented models in Python using TensorFlow and scikit-learn, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions.
Integration: Achieved seamless integration with existing ticketing systems like Jira and ServiceNow through RESTful APIs. This ensures that the predictive system works in tandem with current workflows without requiring significant changes to the existing infrastructure.
User Notifications: Developed an automated notification system using Flask, which provides real-time updates to users about ticket status changes. Notifications are sent via email and within the ticketing system, keeping users informed and improving transparency.
Scalability: Designed the system to be scalable, accommodating an increasing number of tickets and support personnel without degradation in performance. Utilized cloud services to handle data storage and processing needs.

This project provided a hands-on opportunity to apply machine learning techniques in a real-world scenario, focusing on improving IT support efficiency and effectiveness.
