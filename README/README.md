<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### < Introduction >

This project was initiated in accordance with California State University, Sacramento's (CSUS) Computer Science (CS) undergrad graduation requirements. According to the current (as of 2022) CS undergrad course catalog, each CS student - along with a team of up to seven other CS seniors - must complete a year-long, computer science driven project as part of their senior year class load. The project must fulfill a business need for the given client; the client and subsequent project are subject to approval by the CSUS Computer Science Department. 

### < Team - Coding Nerds >

The developers on this project consist of seven Computer Science seniors. We collectively decided to name our team "Coding Nerds"; this is both due to the fact that we are objectively nerds and also do a whole lot of coding. 

Here is a list of our team members:
* Steve Nevins (Team Lead)
* Alex Escobar
* Steven Graham
* Eric Plocher
* Tej Panchal
* Brian Pham
* Mahroona Yasar

### < Client - Perot Museum of Nature and Science >

Our client's business is the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, located in Dallas, Texas. The museum contains over 100 nature and science related exhibits, which notably include  a dinosaur exhibit, bird exhibits, an engineering exhibit, and a gem and mineral exhibit. The museum also hosts education outreach programs such as school field trips, in-school presentations, and virtual programs.

### < Project - Develop an Improved IT Ticketing System >

The museum currently utilizes a third-party, online ticketing system, which allows employees to request services from the museums's IT team and subsequently provides the IT team the ability to track, distribute, and resolve tickets requested by the museum’s employees. Our client feels that the current system is often unintuitive and inefficient for both the IT team and the museum staff; the IT employees often finds themsevles in circumstances in which they are forced to navigate an excessive number of pages and data to locate, update, and coordinate various tickets. Our client has tasked us with producing a more refined and productive website to use when allocating work tickets for the IT team. Our goal is to create a functional prototype that meets the needs of our client before integrating it onto the museum's existing servers for future use by their in-house maintenance department.

## Delivered Product

### Application Summary

In accordance with our client’s needs, we developed a fully-functioning, web-based ticketing system. The ticketing system was built to serve the needs of the museum’s employees by providing a mechanism to request and monitor tickets; it also serves the needs of the museum’s IT team by providing a mechanism to view and modify tickets and manage access to the ticketing system. 

The system can be accessed by museum employees and the museum’s IT staff, both of whom have separate use cases. In light of that, two distinct permission levels have been implemented into the system’s structure, which have been designed to dictate the content and features accessible by the end user. Museum employees are viewed as “Customers” and IT Staff are viewed as “Technicians”.

## System Testing

### Introduction

The final product delivered by our team consists of a data-driven interface and various ticketing and account management related features. A comprehensive suite of functional tests has been assembled to test all the GUI components of the webpage; additionally, several automated, unit tests have been configured to test the system’s back end.

### Functional Testing Conditions

Our functional tests are designed to assess all features accessible via the the website's graphical user interface. These tests have been organized by the various webpages in which the features are visible. All tests include a description, expected behaviour, date, tester's name, and the results. Images of the tests results are also included in each test to further clearly illustrate the outcome.  

### Unit Testing Conditions

The website's backend is powered by AWS. We specifically utilized AWS’s dynamo database services to store data related to the ticketing system, and we designed 12 distinct lambda functions to access and manipulate that data. Each of the lambda functions can be triggered directly via the webpage when a given event occurs; however, the functions can also be tested via built-in unit tests, in which mock JSON data is passed to and from the function. We have assembled a minimum of one such unit test for each function.

## Deployment Instructions

### Downloading The System Files

In order to deploy the website, you must save a local copy of the system's files to your PC. There are two available mechanisms to complete this process:

<b> 1. Download Without GitHub > </b>
